# Digital-Room-Thermometer-Using-7-Segment-Display
A thermometer using a temperature/humidity sensor and a 4-digit 7 segment display. Displayed in Celcius.
<br>
You will of course need a 4 digit display and a temperature sensor, as well as the "SevSeg" library found under library manager
<br>
Start off by wiring the display like this from this website: https://www.circuitbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Arduino-7-Segment-Display-4-Digit-Display-Connection-Diagram.png
<br>
Then go ahead and wire up you sensor by connecting the left pin (sensor facing you) to a pin of your choice, middle pin to 5V, and then the third pin to ground.
<br>
Upload the code in this repo to your Arduino board, it might take a minute depending on your sensor to calibrate with your room temperature.
